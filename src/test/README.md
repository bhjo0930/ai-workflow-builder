## Running Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test                    # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch             # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # Run with coverage report
npm run test:accessibility     # Run accessibility tests
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e              # Run Cypress tests headlessly
npm run test:e2e:open         # Open Cypress test runner
```

## Test Quality Metrics

### Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: >90% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All critical user flows
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user scenarios
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Performance Benchmarks
- Small workflows (10 nodes): <100ms render time
- Medium workflows (50 nodes): <300ms render time
- Large workflows (100 nodes): <1000ms render time
- Very large workflows (200+ nodes): <2000ms render time

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. Some tests require actual file system for complete validation
2. Accessibility testing needs full axe-core integration
3. Performance tests are synthetic and may not reflect real-world usage
4. E2E tests require running development server

### Planned Improvements
1. Visual regression testing with Percy or similar
2. Cross-browser compatibility testing
3. Mobile device testing
4. Load testing for concurrent users
5. API integration testing with mock servers
